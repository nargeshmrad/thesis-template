# 1. The role of video games in shaping societal attitudes toward
gender norms and sexuality (Investigating the role of video
games in shaping gender norms and attitudes)

perceive and understand gender norms and sexuality. It seeks to explore how
video games, as a form of popular media, can reinforce or challenge traditional
gender roles and sexual norms, and the potential impact on broader society. The
research may involve analyzing the representation of gender and sexuality in
video games, investigating the ways in which video games are consumed and
interpreted by players, and exploring the potential of video games as a tool for
promoting inclusivity and diversity. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of
the complex relationship between video games and gender norms and to
contribute to the ongoing discourse around representation and diversity in
popular media.


# Research Questions:
1. How are gender norms and sexuality represented in popular video games, and
what impact does this representation have on player attitudes and behaviors?
2. To what extent do video games reinforce or challenge traditional gender roles
and sexual norms, and how does this impact wider societal attitudes toward
gender and sexuality?
3. Can video games be used as a tool for promoting inclusivity and diversity in
gaming culture, and if so, what design strategies and interventions are most
effective in achieving this goal?

# 2. The intersection of race, gender, and sexuality in video game
design and representation.

# Research Questions:
1. How are diverse racial, gender, and sexual identities represented in video game
design, and to what extent do these representations challenge or reinforce
stereotypes and harmful cultural norms?
2. How do players with diverse racial, gender, and sexual identities interact with
video game narratives and character representations, and what impact does this
have on player attitudes and perceptions?
3. What design strategies and best practices can be employed to promote diversity
and inclusivity in video game design, and how can these strategies be adapted
and implemented across different types of games and platforms?
This topic involves examining the ways in which race, gender, and sexuality
intersect and are represented in video game design and culture. It seeks to
explore how these identity categories are portrayed in video games, and how they
interact with one another to shape the experiences of players. The research may
involve analyzing the representation of diverse racial and ethnic identities, gender
identities, and sexual orientations in video games, and investigating the ways in
which these identities are portrayed and constructed in the game design process.
The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of how these intersectional identities
are depicted in video games and to explore the potential of video games as a tool
for promoting diversity, inclusion, and social justice. By examining the
intersection of race, gender, and sexuality in video game design and
representation, this research aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse around
representation and diversity in popular media and to help foster a more inclusive
and equitable gaming culture.

1. Representation of characters: The representation of characters in video games is
an important aspect to study when it comes to the intersection of race, gender,
and sexuality. For example, the portrayal of women of color in video games is
often lacking, and when they are included, they are often hypersexualized or
stereotyped. In contrast, games like Watch Dogs 2 and Assassin's Creed: Origins
feature diverse casts of characters that challenge stereotypes.
2. Game mechanics and design: Game mechanics and design can also reinforce or
challenge gender and racial stereotypes. For example, games like Grand Theft
Auto V and Saints Row IV allow players to engage in acts of violence against
women and minorities, while games like Horizon Zero Dawn and The Last of Us
Part II feature female protagonists who challenge traditional gender roles.
3. Gaming communities: The gaming community itself is also important to study
when it comes to the intersection of race, gender, and sexuality. For example, the
gaming industry has been criticized for its lack of diversity, both in terms of
representation and workforce. This has led to a lack of opportunities for women
and people of color, as well as discrimination and harassment within the industry.
4. Player experiences: It is important to study the experiences of players from
different backgrounds when it comes to video games. For example, a study
found that Black and Latinx players were more likely to create characters that
resembled themselves in games, while White and Asian players were more likely
to create characters of the opposite gender.



# 3. The use of mythology and folklore in video game narratives and
its impact on player perceptions of gender and culture (The role
of video games in shaping and preserving cultural identity,
mythologies, and heritage in digital media)

# Research Questions:
1. How are mythological and folkloric themes and motifs used in video game
narratives, and what impact does this have on player perceptions of gender and
culture?
2. To what extent can video games be used to preserve and promote cultural
heritage and identity through the incorporation of mythological and folkloric
elements, and how effective are these efforts?

promote cross-cultural understanding and empathy, and what design strategies
and interventions are most effective in achieving this goal?
This topic involves examining the use of mythology and folklore in video game
narratives and how it can impact player perceptions of gender and culture. It
seeks to explore the ways in which video games can be used as a tool for
shaping and preserving cultural identity, mythologies, and heritage in digital
media. The research may involve analyzing the ways in which video game
narratives draw on mythological and folkloric themes and motifs, investigating
the ways in which these narratives portray gender and cultural identities, and
exploring the potential of video games as a tool for promoting cultural
preservation and education. The aim is to gain a deeper understanding of how
video games can be used to engage players in cultural storytelling, foster
empathy and understanding across cultural divides, and promote the
preservation of cultural heritage in a digital age. By exploring the use of
mythology and folklore in video game narratives, this research aims to contribute
to the ongoing discourse around representation and diversity in popular media
and to help foster a more inclusive and culturally rich gaming culture.
